Junify is an app for users to keep track of their favorite music artists and the events on their upcoming schedule! Eventually, Junify will be able to add a friends feature that will allow users to befriend other users that they choose.

- a User should be able to view other users profiles, and add them as a friend/follow that user
- a User should be able to view their own profile which will include a list of all other users they follow - each followed user item on that list will be linked to that specific user's show page

We would like to make sure that the site is secure, meaning each user can log in and see their list of favorite artists, as well as the events, songs, and venues that correspond with them. In order to see a user's favorites list and any information besides basic identificaiton information - a user must have a profile and be logged in.
